# OpenSky Rate Limits

As of July 2022 OpenSky have introduced rate limits that make it useless for aircraft tracking programs
such as Virtual Radar Server. Anonymous users are now limited to 8 minutes of tracking calls and registered
users get just under an hour and a half of tracking calls per day (https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#limitations).

For most VRS users OpenSky is no longer a viable source of ADSB data. For those users that only want to take
the OpenSky feed in short bursts, read on.

# opensky-to-basestation
A command-line utility that fetches state vectors from the Open Sky network and converts
them into a BaseStation format network feed.

## How to install

1. Download the .NET Core 3.1 runtime for your platform:

   https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1

   Choose the **.NET CORE RUNTIME** option. You don't need the SDK version unless you intend building the program.

2. Either download the pre-compiled binaries from the releases page or compile your own build:

   https://github.com/vradarserver/opensky-to-basestation/releases

3. Unzip the pre-compiled binaries and copy to a folder of your choosing.

## Compilation Pre-requisites

You will need the latest version of Visual Studio 2019 Community edition. When you choose the components to install you need
to tick the option for **.NET desktop development**. In the **Individual Components** tab make sure that the
```.NET Core 3.1 SDK``` is ticked.

Once .NET Core 3.1 is no longer the bleeding edge you might see the option called ```.NET Core 3.1 Runtime``` instead.
